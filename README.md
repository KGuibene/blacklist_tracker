# BLT - Blacklist Tracker Addon
A simple addon to help you avoid problematic players by maintaining a personal blacklist copied from a file.

## 🔧 How It Works
- Enable the Addon:
Type `/blt` in game to open the addon UI.

- Apply & Close:
Click “Apply List” and close the window. That’s it!

- Automatic Warnings:
If a player on your blacklist is encountered, you’ll receive an in-game warning.

## 📋 Blacklist Format
Make sure your list follows one of these formats:

- Name - Reason

- Name1/Name2/Name3 - Reason

## 🔁 Note: Keep your blacklist format consistent for best results.

If the format changes or you’d like support for additional formats, I can patch the addon to support them.

## 💡 Suggestions & Feedback
Have ideas or features you’d like to see added? Let me know!

## ⚠️ Important Notes
The blacklist is not persistent yet. You’ll need to paste it again every time you log in.

Future updates will include persistent storage and more quality-of-life features.
